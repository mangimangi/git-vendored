# .github/workflows/dogfood.yml
# Triggers vendor self-update after a successful Bump & Release.
#
# Bridges git-semver (Bump & Release workflow) to git-vendored (install-vendored workflow).
# The .dogfood/resolve script looks for the "git-dogfood" vendor key in
# .vendored/config.json and triggers install-vendored for that vendor.
#
# Chain: merge → Bump & Release → dogfood → install-vendored → PR
