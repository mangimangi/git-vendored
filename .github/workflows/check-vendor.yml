# .github/workflows/check-vendor.yml
# Ensures PRs don't modify protected vendor files.
#
# All logic lives in .vendored/check — this workflow just triggers it.
# The check script reads .vendored/config.json for vendor protection rules,
# skips checking for install branches, and reports violations.
